# Revenue_Insights_In_Hospitality_Domain

This project provides valuable revenue insights for the hospitality industry, focusing on analyzing and predicting revenue trends, occupancy rates, and pricing strategies to improve profitability and operational efficiency. The project leverages data analytics, machine learning models, and visualizations to generate actionable insights for hotel managers and industry stakeholders.

Features
Revenue Analysis: Analyze daily, monthly, and annual revenue trends.
Occupancy Rate Predictions: Predict occupancy rates based on historical data and external factors.
Dynamic Pricing: Implement and analyze pricing strategies to optimize room rates.
Market Segmentation: Segment customer data to identify target groups and tailor pricing.
Data Visualization: Visualize key metrics like RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), and Occupancy Rate.
Forecasting: Use machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost) to forecast future revenue and occupancy.

Data
The project uses historical hotel booking data to perform analysis and predictions. The data includes features such as:

Room Type
Booking Date
Check-in/Check-out Dates
Customer Demographics
Price and Discounts
Hotel Location and Amenities
Note: Replace data/ folder with your own dataset or use publicly available datasets like Booking.com Hotel Data.

How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Raw data is cleaned, transformed, and feature-engineered to prepare for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis are performed to understand revenue patterns, occupancy, and customer behavior.
Models are trained and evaluated for accuracy.
Revenue Optimization: Strategies like dynamic pricing are implemented based on the analysis and predictions to optimize revenue.

Use Cases
Revenue Management: Hotels can use this tool to monitor and optimize their pricing strategies, maximize revenue, and reduce underbooking.
Forecasting: Predict future bookings, occupancy, and revenue for better resource allocation and planning.
Market Analysis: Identify trends in customer behavior and adjust marketing strategies accordingly.
